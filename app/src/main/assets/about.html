    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
    exercising permissions granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    &lt;<a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p><p>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
    the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
    License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>

<h4><a name="section0"></a>0. Additional Definitions.</h4>

<p>As used herein, &ldquo;this License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, and the &ldquo;GNU GPL&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU
    General Public License.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Library&rdquo; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
    other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

<p>An &ldquo;Application&rdquo; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
    by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
    Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
    of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an
    Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
    with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked
    Version&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
    Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
    for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
    based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
    object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
    and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
    Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

<h4><a name="section1"></a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h4>

<p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
    without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

<h4><a name="section2"></a>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</h4>

<p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
    facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
    that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
    facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
    version:</p>

<ul>
    <li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
        ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
        function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
        whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</li>

    <li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
        this License applicable to that copy.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section3"></a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h4>

<p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
    a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
    code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
    material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
    layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
    (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
        Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
        covered by this License.</li>

    <li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
        document.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Combined Works.</h4>

<p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
    taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
    portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
    the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
        the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
        covered by this License.</li>

    <li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
        document.</li>

    <li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
        execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
        these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
        copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</li>

    <li>d) Do one of the following:

        <ul>
            <li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
                License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
                suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
                recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
                the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
                manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
                Corresponding Source.</li>

            <li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
                a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
                system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
                of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
                Version.</li>
        </ul></li>

    <li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
        be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
        GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
        necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
        Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
        Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
        you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
        the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
        Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
        Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
        for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section5"></a>5. Combined Libraries.</h4>

<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side by side in a single library together with other library
    facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
    License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
    choice, if you do both of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
        on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
        conveyed under the terms of this License.</li>

    <li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
        is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
        accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section6"></a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h4>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
    Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
    of the GNU Lesser General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo;
    applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that published version or of any later version
    published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
    received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
    whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
    apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
    permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
    Library.</p>
